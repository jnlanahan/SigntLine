# Taking SightLine to production

What's ready, what's deliberately deferred, and the order to do the rest in.

---

## Where things stand

The app runs end-to-end with **no backend**. Sessions, memory, and saved plans
persist to disk on the user's machine; API keys live in Windows Credential
Manager. That is a real, shippable configuration — not a stub — and it is what
the Neon and AWS steps below build on rather than replace.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Coaching loop, voice, memory, history | Working, local |
| Screenshots | In memory only, never written to disk |
| Session history + memory + plans | JSON files under `%APPDATA%/SightLine/data` |
| API keys | Windows Credential Manager (via `keytar`/`safeStorage`) |
| Accounts / sign-in | **Not built** — every record already carries a `user_id` column, currently null |
| Neon Postgres | **Not connected** — schema written and ready to apply |
| AWS S3 | **Not needed yet** — see "Do you actually need S3?" below |

## 1. Add the ElevenLabs key (5 minutes, biggest quality win)

The single highest-impact thing you can do before showing this to anyone.

1. Create a key at <https://elevenlabs.io> → Profile → API Keys.
2. Put it in `.env` as `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...` (see `.env.example`).
3. Restart the app. Settings → Voice → pick a voice → **Preview**.

The status line under the picker tells you which provider actually spoke. If it
says "ElevenLabs — the good one", you're set. If it falls back to Google, the
key or the account's credit balance is the problem — the app will keep working
either way.

Voices are fetched live from your account, so any custom or cloned voice you
create shows up in the picker automatically.

## 2. Neon Postgres (when you want history off one machine)

The schema is already written, as SQL, in
[`electron/db/schema.ts`](../electron/db/schema.ts) — exported as
`POSTGRES_SCHEMA` and kept in the same file as the TypeScript types it mirrors,
so the two can't drift unnoticed.

**Tables:** `users`, `sessions`, `session_steps`, `session_turns`,
`memory_facts`, `training_plans`.

### Applying it

```bash
# 1. Create a project at https://console.neon.tech and copy the connection string
# 2. Dump the schema constant to a file and apply it
node -e "import('./dist-electron/main.mjs')" # or copy POSTGRES_SCHEMA by hand
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f schema.sql
```

### Wiring it up

Every read and write already goes through one module:
[`electron/db/store.ts`](../electron/db/store.ts). It exports plain functions —
`saveSession`, `listSessions`, `listFacts`, `saveFacts`, `listPlans`, and so on.
Nothing above that file knows how persistence works.

To move to Neon: write `electron/db/store-postgres.ts` exporting the same
function signatures, and switch the import in `electron/main.ts`. That's the
whole change. Keep the local store as the offline fallback — a coaching session
should not fail because a database is unreachable.

**Order matters:** do auth before Neon, or every row lands with a null
`user_id` and you'll be backfilling. The columns and foreign keys are already
in the schema.

## 3. Do you actually need S3?

Probably not, and it's worth being clear about why.

Screenshots are the only large artifact this app produces, and they are
**deliberately never persisted** — they exist in memory for the length of a
session and are gone when it ends. That's a privacy property worth keeping: the
app watches your screen, and the strongest promise it can make is that it
doesn't keep what it saw.

Everything that *is* stored is text: transcripts, step lists, memory facts. A
heavy user generates a few megabytes a year. That belongs in Postgres, not
object storage.

Add S3 (or Cloudflare R2) only if you later decide to support:

- **Session recordings** — replaying what the screen looked like. This reverses
  the privacy property above; make it opt-in and per-session, never a default.
- **Exported training plans** as PDF or video.
- **Uploaded reference material** larger than the current text-file limit.

If you do: `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_S3_BUCKET` are already reserved in
`.env.example`. Serve through CloudFront with signed URLs, and set a lifecycle
rule to expire recordings — storing screen recordings indefinitely is a
liability, not a feature.

## 4. Authentication

Not built, by design — it's the dependency you said could come later, and
nothing else is blocked on it.

What's already in place:

- `user_id` on every table, nullable, with the foreign keys defined.
- A `users` table with `email` and `display_name`.
- `SessionRecord.userId` and `MemoryFact.userId` plumbed through the app, set
  to `null` today.

What to do when you add it: populate those fields at session start, filter
`listSessions()` and `listFacts()` by the signed-in user, and backfill existing
local rows to the first account on first sign-in.

## 5. Pre-release checklist

### Verify

```bash
npm run lint     # tsc over both compilation targets
npm test         # 258 unit tests
npm run build    # production Vite + esbuild bundle
npm run dev      # launch and click through it
```

Runtime behaviour — audio, capture, pacing — needs a real run. The automated
tests cover the pure logic, not how it feels.

### Manual pass

- [ ] Start a Tech Support session and confirm the first step arrives and is spoken
- [ ] Hold the push-to-talk key mid-sentence — the coach should stop *immediately*
- [ ] Open the plan; confirm it pushes the conversation down rather than covering it
- [ ] Check the cost pill moves, and that Settings → Spend can cap a session
- [ ] Complete a session, then start a new one and confirm it remembers something
- [ ] Settings → Memory → "Review what it remembers" → forget a fact
- [ ] Unplug/replug a monitor while docked; the sidebar should recover
- [ ] Settings → Diagnostics → Open log file, and confirm `[loop]` lines explain the pacing

### Before the installer

- [ ] `build/icon.ico` exists (referenced by `package.json` → `build.win.icon`)
- [ ] Bump `version` in `package.json`
- [ ] Confirm `.env` is **not** in the build — keys come from Credential Manager
- [ ] `npm run dist` and install the output on a clean machine
- [ ] Code-sign the installer, or Windows SmartScreen will warn every user

## 6. What it costs to run

Measured against the actual payload the loop sends (see
`src/__tests__/usage.test.ts`, which fails if a change inflates it):

| Usage | Claude calls/hour | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Typical session | ~130 | **~$1.09** |
| Heavy — a call every 18s | 200 | **~$1.79** |

Plus roughly $0.05–0.15/hour of ElevenLabs speech.

The default cap is $3/session, chosen as a runaway guard rather than a ration —
a cap that trips mid-task is worse than no cap. It's adjustable in Settings.

Three things keep this down, and all three are worth preserving:

1. **The system prompt is cached.** It's byte-identical across ticks, which is
   why per-tick data goes in the user message. If cache hit rate collapses (it's
   logged every tick), something has leaked into the prefix.
2. **Only the latest screenshot is full resolution.** History frames go at
   640px — 4x cheaper, and they only exist to answer "what changed".
3. **Most ticks never reach Claude at all.** The frame comparator and the gate
   in `src/lib/loopGate.ts` skip unchanged screens.

---

## 7. Known limits

- **Windows only.** Docking uses the Windows AppBar API through native FFI, and
  screen calibration works around a Windows-specific display-ID bug. A macOS
  port needs a different mechanism for both.
- **Push-to-talk needs an OpenAI key** for Whisper transcription. Typed
  follow-ups work without it.
- **History caps at 500 sessions** and memory at 400 facts, pruned
  oldest-unused-first.
- **No multi-device sync** until Neon and auth are wired.
