// The Training agent — a patient coach walking the user through a
// multi-session training plan that SightLine designed for them.
//
// Skills, in prompt order:
//   speech   → voice rules + the instruction field
//   observe  → silence discipline; scans build the record, never speech
//   plan     → the observed activity log, WITH the atomic edit tools
//   review   → check-my-work / I'm-stuck button behaviour, verdict + mistake fields
//   notes    → within-session scratchpad
//   memory   → durable facts about the user's setup and how they learn
//
// The mode's whole shape: the user practices the current task at their own
// pace; the 60-second scans silently record what they do; speech happens only
// when the user asks for it — the "Check my work" and "I'm stuck" buttons,
// which arrive through the follow-up path. The curriculum itself (modules,
// tasks, done criteria, progress) lives in the persisted TrainingPlan record
// and reaches the agent as the training context block; the loop's flat step
// list is the per-session activity log, not the plan.

Generate exactly 4-5 short, specific intake questions. Do NOT take the stated topic at face value — probe for the real goal. Cover: (1) what they actually want to be able to DO at the end, and why (job, project, curiosity); (2) their honest current level with this skill; (3) which app or tool they'll practice in on this computer; (4) how long a typical practice session will be; (5) anything the goal makes ambiguous. For each question, provide 3-4 answer options: the first 2 the most common answers, the rest reasonable alternatives. Output JSON only:

  planPrompt: `You design a personal training curriculum that a screen-watching coach app will walk the user through over weeks of hands-on sessions. Given their goal and intake answers, produce:
- "title": a short plan name.
- "overview": a casual spoken overview under 60 words — what they'll build toward and roughly how long it'll take.
- "learnerProfile": 1-2 sentences distilling their level, pace, and how they want to learn (from the intake answers).
- "modules": the full journey as small modules. SIZE THE PLAN TO THE GOAL: a skill learnable in an afternoon gets 2-3 modules; a deep skill (a programming language, machine learning, a professional tool end-to-end) gets 6-12. Each module: "title", "summary" (one line — what it covers and why it comes next), "taskTitles" (2-5 hands-on tasks, each an action phrase sized to roughly one sitting).

Design rules: anchor the whole plan on one concrete project or outcome the user actually cares about — every module should produce a visible piece of it. Practice must happen in the app they said they'd use, on their real screen. Order modules so early wins come fast. Do not write objectives or completion criteria — those are added per module later, informed by how earlier modules went.

export const MODULE_DETAIL_PROMPT = `You are detailing ONE module of an in-progress personal training curriculum. The user message carries the plan's goal, learner profile, the module list with statuses, the journal of how past sessions actually went, recurring mistake patterns, and the module to detail (its title, summary, and draft task titles).

Rewrite that module's tasks as concrete, gradeable units. You may refine titles, split or merge tasks (keep 2-5), and should adapt to what the journal shows — slow down on what they struggled with, skip what they've clearly absorbed. Each task:
- "title": an action phrase, under 8 words.
- "objective": one sentence, "You will be able to …".
- "doneCriteria": 2-4 observable criteria a screen-watching coach can verify ("the pivot table shows monthly totals", "the query runs without errors"). Criteria must be visible on screen — never "understands X".
