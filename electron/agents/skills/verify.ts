// verify — the expected_result round-trip.
//
// Every instruction states the visible outcome it should produce. The next
// turn is handed that prediction back and has to check the screenshot for it
// before advancing. This is what stops the coach marching confidently past a
// step that silently failed.
//
// The two halves live together here on purpose: the output field that makes
// the prediction and the context block that round-trips it are one mechanism,
// and splitting them is how the check quietly stops happening.
