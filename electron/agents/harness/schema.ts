// Assembles an agent's request surface — system prompt, tool definitions, and
// the terminal say/wait schemas — from its skill list.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE MUST BE BYTE-STABLE ACROSS TICKS. Tool definitions render
// ahead of the system prompt, which renders ahead of the messages, so a single
// changed byte in either invalidates the whole cached prefix and every later
// tick silently pays full price. That means: build only from the static skill
// array, never from runtime state, and never sort with a comparator that could
// tie-break differently. Plain object key order is insertion order in JS, so
// building the schema in skill order is deterministic by construction.
//
// Locked by src/__tests__/agentHarness.test.ts.
