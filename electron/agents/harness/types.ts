// The agent harness contract.
//
// Three things every agent owns, and one thing it does not:
//
//   skills  — composable units of behaviour. A skill contributes prompt text,
//             tools, per-turn context, and fields on the terminal tool. Skills
//             are shared freely between agents (see ../skills/).
//   tools   — what the model can actually DO mid-turn, beyond speaking.
//   loop    — when this agent wants to look at the screen (LoopPolicy), plus
//             an optional shouldTick() for behaviour a policy can't express.
//
// What an agent does NOT own is the loop *executor*. Ticking needs the frame
// hash, the TTS queue, and the session store, all of which live in the
// renderer — so the agent declares the policy and the renderer runs it. That
// split is deliberate: the scheduler is infrastructure, the cadence is the
// agent's. See src/hooks/useSessionLoop.ts.
//
// Pure module — no Electron imports, so the whole harness is unit-testable.
