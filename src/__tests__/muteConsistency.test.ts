// Root cause: the session-plan overview was spoken WITHOUT checking
// `ttsEnabled`, while every other spoken line checked it. A muted app
// therefore talked exactly once — at session start — and then stayed silent
// for the rest of the session. That reads as "it won't read the steps out
// loud", not as "the voice is muted", which is why it survived so long.
//
// The invariant: if the coach is muted, it is muted everywhere. If it is not
// muted, it speaks everywhere.
